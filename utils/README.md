Jacoco
------
these are the Jacoco utilities, used to determine code coverage
from our tests.

They are version 0.8.10, found here: https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/index.html

There are two files: the agent, used to generate the raw coverage data,
and the cli utility, used to generate the HTML report from the data.
